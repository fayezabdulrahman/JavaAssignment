My Assignment is the abusive content detector.

Brief of what the project does
	1-Reads and displays your file
	2-Scan your file for bad words
	3-Enter a Sentence/Paragraph and scan it for bad words
	4-Write a word to the bad words file
	5-Censor bad words


Rules it must follow: 
1) Check for English words only
2) Commonly used curse words make the text highly abusive
3) The result is graded on a scale against the percentage of how bad the text is

The algorithm takes the size of the bad word file, and then the size is multiplied by how many times there is a bad word occurred and is then divided by 100 to get the percentage. 

This is how it determines how bad the file is and it evaluates it based on this percentage. 

The program uses ArrayLists.
The first array list is used to store the bad words in it.
It is splitted by a new line.
So each word has its own index value.

The user file is also placed in an array list.
And it is splitted by a space.
So also each word has its own index value

The algorithm is tested by using an enhanced for loop and it checks if the user word exits in the bad word array. ( using .contains method ) if it does a counter is incremented.

This counter is then used to get the percentage and then the percentage evaluates how badly abusive the content is.

This is the program in a nut shell.

( NOTE: Some of the words included are very in appropriate )
